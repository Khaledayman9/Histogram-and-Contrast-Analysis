# Histogram-and-Contrast-Calculation
Experiment with histogram modification approaches, alongside  seeing their effects on images. This aims to provide practical insights into image processing methods for enhancing contrast, essential in fields such as digital photography, medical imaging, and computer vision applications.

# Description
The main aim of this assignment is to experiment with histogram modification approaches, alongside seeing their effects on images. In more details, given an input image, as a first step, the contrast of such an image is to be evaluated. Second, the three approaches (contrast stretching, histogram equalization, and gray-scale transformation) are to be performed in the input image (producing three outputs). Finally, for each of the three outputs, the contrast is re-evaluated. As per that, the following components are to be implemented: 
1. Co-occurrence matrix and calculate contrast. 
2. Calculate Histograms: 
  a. Image histogram. 
  b. Cumulative histogram. 
  c. Color covering percentage. 
3. Modify histogram: 
  a. Contrast stretching  
  b. Histogram equalization 
  c. Gray-scale transformation
